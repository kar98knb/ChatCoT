Kaiser to provide steel plate for the Pacific Coast shipbuilding industry, which expanded during World War II, then shrank, then expanded again during the Korean War.  California Shipbuilding Corporation on Terminal Island, California, was one of these shipyards which built hundreds of Liberty ships and Victory ships in World War II, and was also a project of Henry Kaiser.  Kaiser Steel was noted for making the most of its costly steelmaking inputs, and it captured, along with the U.S. Steel plant in Utah, much of the Pacific Coast steel market by the late 1950s.  Its assets included steelmaking plants in Napa, California (that it acquired from Basalt Rock Company in 1955) and Fontana, California (now operated by California Steel Industries), and a former open-pit iron ore mine at Eagle Mountain, California.  Steel manufactured was also used in Kaiser Motors.",

Kaiser ranked 20th among U.S. corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.  The shipyards were owned by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, a creation of American industrialist Henry J. Kaiser, (1882-1967), who established the shipbuilding company around 1939 in order to help meet the construction goals set by the United States Maritime Commission for merchant shipping."

Since then it has continued to grow larger and more professional, now involving professional drivers with sponsored cars.  The series now includes two championships: Pro and Pro-sport.  New competitors generally need to prove themselves in the Pro-sport championship before entering the Pro championship (unless coming from an equivalent international series).  Organizers aim to promote and educate Drifting in New Zealand, with a regulated safe environment.  Despite similar moniker, the series is not related to the Japanese D1 Grand Prix series.  It has been recognised as the longest running drifting series in the world.",

Sporting a new animation style, \"Teen Titans Go!\"  serves as a comedic spin-off with no continuity to the previous series, and only certain elements are retained.  Many DC characters make cameo appearances and are referenced in the background.  The original principal voice cast returns to reprise their respective roles.",

The third incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act.  It was the country's first peacetime draft.  From 1940 until 1973, during both peacetime and periods of conflict, men were drafted to fill vacancies in the United States Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means.  The draft was ended when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all-volunteer military force.  However, the Selective Service System remains in place as a contingency plan; all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register so that a draft can be readily resumed if needed.\nIs this evidence useful?"

The sexual relationship took place between 1995 and 1996 and came to light in 1998.  Clinton ended a televised speech with the statement that he did not have sexual relations with Lewinsky.  Further investigation led to charges of perjury and to the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives.  He was subsequently acquitted on all impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in a 21-day Senate trial.  Clinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony in the Paula Jones case regarding Lewinsky and was also fined $90,000 by Wright.  His license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years; shortly thereafter, he was disbarred from presenting cases in front of the United States Supreme Court.",
        "The White House Doctor: My Patients Were Presidents – A Memoir is a book authored by Connie Mariano, the first military woman in the history of the United States to be appointed as Physician to the President, the first female director of the medical unit of the White House, and the first Filipino-American to become a rear admiral in the US Navy.  With a foreword from Bill Clinton, the autobiographical book takes a look at the personal lives of three American Presidents (George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush) and three American First Ladies (Barbara Bush, Hillary Clinton, and Laura Bush) she had taken care of while working as a White House physician.  It was described as a \"fascinating look into what goes on behind closed doors at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue\"."

        "Fred John Hageman (born June 30, 1937 in Bunkie, Louisiana) is a former American football linebacker in the National Football League for the Washington Redskins.  He played college football at the University of Arkansas and University of Kansas, and was drafted in the 2nd round in 1959 by the Oakland Raiders but did not report and returned to Kansas to finish his undergraduate degree and play out his senior season where he was a 2 time All Big 8 selection as a center and middle linebacker.  He was a Tri-Captain and played in 4 post season games including the College All-Star game with numerous All Americans.  Was drafted in the 7th round of the 1960 NFL Draft by the New York Giants and was immediately traded to Washington for cash and a high draft pick.  He was the \"Tribe's\" defensive leader and starting middle linebacker upon reporting to camp.  He was a runner-up for Rookie of the Year as a middle linebacker and played more minutes than any other player in the NFL in 1961.  After his first stellar season, he was moved to starting Center where he played at an elite level.  He was traded to the Chicago Bears in 1965, where he was injured in a pre-season game.  Although urged to return by many, Fred returned to Kansas and earned his master's degree in Education.  He went on to a very successful business career.  The \"gentle giant\" at a huge 6 foot 5 and 255 pounds of solid muscle with world class speed, Fred was named as Kansas University's \"Center of the Century\" and was named to its first team \"All-Time KU Football Team\" along with the likes of Gayle Sayers, John Hadl and other NFL greats.  Known as \"Pappy\" to many, he led KU's team, to a #2 Ranking and a Big 8 Championship in 1960.  Some believe the teams he led in 1959 and 1960, along with John Hadl, were the best in KU's history.  Fred was enshrined in the Batesville, Arkansas Area Sports Hall of Fame in 1992.  He was the first All-State Athlete at Batesville, H.S.",
        "Ronald Wayne Snidow (December 30, 1941 – May 17, 2009) was an American football defensive tackle in the National Football League for the Washington Redskins and the Cleveland Browns.  He attended San Rafael High School in California.  He played college football at the University of Oregon.  The Washington Redskins drafted Snidow in the third round of the 1963 NFL draft.  After five seasons with the Redskins, he was traded to the Cleveland Browns in exchange for a second round draft choice, just prior to the opening of the 1968 season.  Snidow was first-team All-Pro with the Browns in 1969.  He appeared in 126 career regular season games.  After suffering a broken leg while playing with the Browns, he retired at the end of the 1972 season, having played 10 years in the NFL.  After retiring from the NFL, Snidow worked as a commercial real estate broker in Southern California, until he retired.  In 2008, Snidow was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease, which he died from a year later on May 17, 2009, while on a vacation cruise off the coast of Italy on the island of Elba.",

        "Spynie Palace, also known as Spynie Castle, was the fortified seat of the Bishops of Moray for about 500 years.  The founding of the palace dates back to the late 12th Century.  It is situated at Grid Ref NJ 230658, about 500m from the location of the first officially settled Cathedral Church of the Diocese of Moray, in present-day Spynie Churchyard.  For most of its occupied history, the castle was not described as a \"palace\" — this term first appeared in the Registry of Moray in a writ of 1524.",
        "Bishop Dunbar's Hospital was founded in 1531 by Bishop Gavin Dunbar, the Elder.  The hospital was endowed by a mortification just before his death.  Dunbar petitioned the King, James V of Scotland, and the charter, signed on 24 February 1531 records the King’s approval that ‘[Dunbar shall] ... \"found an hospital near the cathedral church, but outside the cemetery\"...’ It was also known as St Mary's Hospital.  In the mortification, Dunbar's charitable purpose is recorded.  Bedesmen were supported by a charitable foundation that emerged from the original church control until the twenty-first century.  Bedesmen drew their name from the word \"bede\" - a prayer.  The residents of Dunbar's Hospital said prayers in a cycle of Divine Office.  The Bede House, Old Aberdeen was used by the Bedesmen from the hospital from 1789 to the end of the nineteenth century.  The only remains of the 1531 building can be seen in a perimeter wall for Seaton Park in Old Aberdeen.  The last Bedesman died in 1988.  The Managers of the Hospital constituted a Charity, Bishop Dunbar Hospital Trust.  The Charity ceased active operation in 2012."

He later arranged his compositions for studio orchestras and explored a variety of other styles, often incorporating classical or jazz elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways.",

He was one of 24 ballplayers who profited from the advent of MLB free agency following the 1976 season.  A torn rotator cuff rendered his playing career into a cautionary tale of the risks of signing pitchers to free-agent contracts of seven years or longer.  The article outlined how Garland was constantly criticized by Cleveland's incompetent management for not living up to his contract (even though his decline in performance was entirely due to a serious arm injury that could not be fixed effectively by mid-1970's sports medicine) and had fans savagely booing him and even vandalizing his car during games.\nIs this evidence useful?"

However, the names \"Senators\", \"Nationals\" and shorter \"Nats\" were used interchangeably by fans and media for the next sixty years; in , the latter two names were revived for the current National League franchise that had previously played in Montreal.  For a time, from 1911 to 1933, the Senators were one of the more successful franchises in Major League Baseball.  The team's rosters included Baseball Hall of Fame members Goose Goslin, Sam Rice, Joe Cronin, Bucky Harris, Heinie Manush and one of the greatest players and pitchers of all time, Walter Johnson.  But the Senators are remembered more for their many years of mediocrity and futility, including six last-place finishes in the 1940s and 1950s.  Joe Judge, Cecil Travis, Buddy Myer, Roy Sievers and Eddie Yost were other notable Senators players whose careers were spent in obscurity due to the team's lack of success.\nIs this evidence useful?"

In the second part, as all the chimney sweepers get in the house of George Banks, Mrs. Brill walks into the living room looking at them and screams, \"They're at it again!\"  and she runs away trying to strike one of the chimney sweepers with a frying pan.  As Jane, Michael, Mary Poppins and Bert get in the same place, Ellen runs around the dining room with an \"OW!\"  and the chimney sweepers flip her.  The other phrases in the rest of the musical number are \"Votes for women,\" \"It's the master,\" and \"What's all this?\"",
        "\"Mary Poppins\" is a song from the 2015 stage musical \"Love Birds\" with music and lyrics by Robert J. Sherman.  It is sung by \"The Original Quack Pack\", a penguin barbershop quartet who resemble the penguins from the 1964 Walt Disney motion picture, \"Mary Poppins\".  In dialogue leading up to the song, the penguins explain that while they did know the same nanny, (Mary Poppins) they are not the same penguins as in the movie.  The song expresses their longing for the magical nanny of literary fame."

Founded in 1964 with contributions from equestrienne Esther du Pont Thouron and others, each year the George D. Widener Hospital for Large Animals (named for horseman George D. Widener, Jr.) sees more than 4,000 patient visits, and its Field Service sees more than 31,000 patient visits.  In addition to its role as one of the nation’s finest equine surgical facilities, New Bolton Center encompasses hospital facilities for the care of large animals and livestock as well as diagnostic laboratories serving the agriculture industry and the monitoring of emerging infectious disease.  Prior to the opening of \"New\" Bolton Center in 1952, the old Bolton Mansion in Levittown was the site of the farm for the School of Veterinary Medicine."

        "\"Cinizasaurus\" is an informal name for fossilized remains from the Late Triassic of New Mexico that were initially interpreted as belonging to a theropod dinosaur.  The remains, NMMNH P-18400, consist of a tibia, vertebrae, and fragments, and came from the ? late Carnian-age Upper Triassic Bluewater Creek Member of the Chinle Formation, near Fort Wingate.  Andrew Heckert, in his unpublished thesis, proposed the name \"Cinizasaurus hunti\" for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007).  In the redescription, the authors could only assign the material to Archosauriformes.",
        "Fruitadens is a genus of heterodontosaurid dinosaur.  The name means \"Fruita tooth\", in reference to Fruita, Colorado (USA), where its fossils were first found.  It is known from partial skulls and skeletons from at least four individuals of differing biological ages, found in Tithonian (Late Jurassic) rocks of the Morrison Formation in Colorado.  \"Fruitadens\" is the smallest known ornithischian dinosaur, with young adults estimated at 65 to in length and 0.5 to in weight.  It is interpreted as an omnivore and represents one of the latest-surviving heterodontosaurids.",
        "Sphaerotholus is a genus of pachycephalosaurid dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of the western United States and Canada.  To date, three species have been described: the type species, \"S. goodwini\", from the Den-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation (Late Campanian) of San Juan County, New Mexico, USA; \"S. buchholtzae\", from the Hell Creek Formation (Late Maastrichtian) of western Carter County, Montana, USA; and \"S. edmontonense\", from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada.  The etymology of \"Sphaerotholus\" is a combination of the Greek \"sphaira\", meaning \"ball\", and \"tholos\", meaning \"dome\", and is a reference to the characteristically dome-shaped pachycephalosaurian skull.  The survival of \"Sphaerotholus\" from the Campanian of New Mexico to the end of the Maastrichtian of Montana demonstrates that this taxon had both a relatively long duration (approximately 7-8 million years) and a widespread distribution.  Williamson and Carr, who first described the genus in 2002, diagnose it as follows: \"Differs from all other pachycephalosaurids where known in the possession of a parietosquamosal bar that decreases in depth laterally as seen in caudal view and is bordered by a single row of nodes and one lateroventral corner node.\"  \"Sphaerotholus\" is considered a highly derived pachycephalosaur."

McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity.  In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions.  Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts in time signature from standard 4/4 to 9/8, while the songwords reflect the era of its genesis by recalling themes first espoused in the Beatles tracks \"Within You Without You\" and \"All You Need Is Love\".\nIs this evidence useful?"

It was Harrison's second composition in the Indian classical style, after \"Love You To\", and was inspired by his six-week stay in India with his mentor and sitar teacher, Ravi Shankar, over September–October 1966.  Recorded in London without the other Beatles, the song features Indian instrumentation such as sitar, dilruba and tabla, and was performed by Harrison and members of the Asian Music Circle.  The recording marked a significant departure from the Beatles' previous work; musically, it evokes the Indian devotional tradition, while the overtly spiritual quality of the lyrics reflects Harrison's absorption in Hindu philosophy and the teachings of the Vedas.  Although the song was his only composition on \"Sgt. Pepper\", Harrison's endorsement of Indian culture was further reflected in the inclusion of yogis such as Paramahansa Yogananda among the crowd depicted on the album cover.\nIs this evidence useful?"

From 1946 to 1976 it was known as the People's Republic of Albania, and from 1944 to 1946 as the Democratic Government of Albania.  Throughout this period the country had a reputation for its Stalinist style of state administration dominated by Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labour of Albania and for policies stressing national unity and self-reliance.  Travel and visa restrictions made Albania one of the most difficult countries to visit or to travel from.  In 1967, it declared itself the world's first atheist state.  It was the only Warsaw Pact member to formally withdraw from the alliance before 1990, an action occasioned by the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.  The first multi-party elections in Socialist Albania took place on 31 March 1991 – the communists gained a majority in an interim government and the first parliamentary elections were held on 22 March 1992.  The People's Socialist Republic was officially dissolved on 28 November 1998 upon the adoption of the new Constitution of Albania."
